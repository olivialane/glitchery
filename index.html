        My research question asks how we can overcome the sexist history of design for women’s bodies to create feminist digital climates. This subject matter is an intersectional one, spanning race, disability, age and more, but here my focus revolves around women. In regards to this report, I define sexist design as any design which either knowingly or unknowingly excludes women. Under this definition, many of the systems that we use in our daily lives could be viewed as sexist design. I say this not to lay blame onto the individuals or groups that designed them, but to understand where they went wrong so we can un-design these flaws out of our digital landscape.  
       </p>
       <p class="body-text">
        This Report interrogates the positionality of my practice in the conversations around reconfiguring gender imbalances within the design industry. It accompanies a project which uses the principles of assemblage to dissect and reposition technology and feminism in an interactive experience by using play to highlight these ovesights. The root of this project is distinctly Cyberfeminist in both theme and format, the word breaks down into ‘cyber’ and ‘feminism’, the intersection of these two words acting as a wide angle lens focusing on incorporating feminist thought alongside technology, The term is self-reflexive: technology is not only the subject of cyberfeminism, but its means of transmission. It’s all about feedback. <a id="seu" class="citation" href="https://cyberfeminismindex.com/about/">(Seu, M. 2019)</a> 
       </p>
       <p class="body-text">
        Throughout this report, I consider how the cyberfeminist lens can use speculation to inspire discussions around women’s bodies. I also argue the case for the role of collage as a fundamentally feminist practice, a practice that uses scraps and innovation to build something of use or beauty. Through collage I investigate how the world of witches and technology can intersect, patching together magic and technology and wonder into a cyberfeminist practice.

      In 1960, Henry Dreyfuss published The Measure of Man <a a id="measure-of-man" class="citation" href="Dreyfuss, H. (1960) THE MEASURE OF MAN [Human Factors in Design]. New York: Whitney Library of Design.">(1960)</a> which helped to establish ergonomics within design <a id="julier" class="citation" href="https://search.credoreference.com/articles/Qm9va0FydGljbGU6MTk2MjAzMw==?aid=275139">(Julier, 2004).</a> The book includes the standardised dimensions of the ‘average’ man, woman and child of the time but fails to include the female body when documenting activities such as walking, climbing and sitting. It is inferred that women sit, walk and climb like men do, or that they simply do not do these activities at all. The practice of Ergonomics aimed to avoid any mismatch between people and objects or spaces by the application of scientific information concerning human beings to the problems of design <a id="ergonomics" class="citation" href="https://search.credoreference.com/articles/Qm9va0FydGljbGU6MTk2MjA1MQ==">(“Ergonomics”, 2004).</a> It is therefore possible to understand how this has led to systems that have been designed to cater to the standard male body, with little consideration for the female body. Designing to one standard of what a ‘body’ is results in unintended consequences for anyone who doesn’t fit those specifications.

      The paper If the Chair Fits: Sexism in American Office Furniture Design by Jennifer Kaufmann-Buhler <a id="buhler" class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jdh/epz022">(2019)</a> investigates the history of office chair design, in which secretarial chairs were made smaller in stature, without armrests or back support. This stood in direct contradiction to executive chairs, made with larger seats, backs and armrests. A small statured woman would be uncomfortable in an executive chair, whilst a tall man would be uncomfortable in a secretarial chair. Obviously women become secretaries and men are born to be executives. Despite their obviously sexist origins, these names have adhered themselves to modern day chair designs, with little regard for their implications. When the bodies using these chairs do not fit the intended demographic, we begin to see how the design of these chairs can have unintended health detriments to the people using them. In “Kevin Roche’s mock-ups for the proposed clerical and secretarial workspaces for the new Union Carbide headquarters in the late 1970s, some male workers commented that the selected chairs, Steelcase model 421-520, a secretarial chair, and 421-312, a clerical-style armchair (similar to the secretarial chair but with arms), were not comfortable for them because of their size.” (Kaufmann-Buhler, 2019)

     </div>
     <p class="body-text">
      Here we see that the women’s experience remains undocumented, but it would be safe to assume that women using executive chairs might feel uncomfortable if they were too big for them. The experience of trying to stretch to fill a seat that is too big for me is one well familiar. It is also one that is not healthy for anyone using a chair that is the wrong design for them, NHS England quotes poor posture while sitting or standing at work to be one of the most common causes of repetitive strain injuries <a id="nhs" class="citation" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/repetitive-strain-injury-rsi/">(NHS, 2022).</a> When we design based on standards, we create objects that don’t serve a lot of the population. This is more easily reversed in the physical world where it is possible to reimagine how we design a chair. It is more challenging to change oversights in design decisions in tech spheres due to an economic theory known as Path Dependence <a id="puffert" class="citation" href="https://search.credoreference.com/articles/Qm9va0FydGljbGU6MTgyNDc3Ng==?aid=275139">(Puffert, 2001)</a> which happens when many people adopt a technology and build upon it. This can cause the technology to become concrete, despite it sometimes not being the best design option. We’ve seen this occur in the Y2K bug panic of the late 90s and in the continued use of the QWERTY keyboard. But what implications could a bug of this scale have when inevitably, one of these oversights are in relation to race or gender? 
     </p>
     <p class="body-text">
      In a modern day context, we have seen errors formed by race and gender related oversights in relation to facial recognition technologies (FRT) which have been trained on bias datasets. See for example the case of Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at MIT (2017) who whilst creating a software which was meant to be responsive to a users face, realised that the facial analysis program used for the software couldn’t recognise the faces of people who were not white <a id="hardesty" class="citation" href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-02">(Hardesty, 2018).</a> In fact, in Buolamwini’s 2018 study “Gender Shades” project, it was found that algorithms performed the worst on darker-skinned females, with error rates up to 34% higher than for lighter-skinned males <a id="buolamwini" class="citation" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf">(Buolamwini, 2018).</a> The implications of inaccurate facial recognition are presented in the documentary film Coded Bias <a id="coded-bias" class="citation" href="https://www.netflix.com/search?q=coded%20bias&jbv=81328723">(2020).</a> We see the police use FRT on the streets of London to profile and apprehend a young Black boy on the basis that the algorithm determined a match. The algorithm was incorrect.

     <p class="body-text">
      The design industry seems to dwell on the perils of new technologies, exemplified by the AI panic that has swept through the creative industries recently. However, there seems to be little optimistic consideration for how we can make technologies work in more ethical ways. A project created in Kyoto University sees an AI software named Buddhabot <a id="kumagi" class="citation" href="http://kokoro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kumagai_buddhabot_nhk-news_20221003en/">(Kumagi, S. 2021)</a> trained on Buddhist methodology. Buddhabot resides within an app and was made to show people how to apply “old wisdom to their lives in this modern society, and seek ways to become happier.” <a id="osaki" class="citation" href="https://phys.org/news/2022-10-hey-buddha-japan-ai-enlightenment.html ">(Osaki, 2022).</a> This project delivers a healthy dose of optimism to a narrative which usually perpetuates fear. Whilst a considered wariness of the technology that we use is healthy, we may wonder how we can create a positive use for it in the future if we can not at least imagine it.

      Future Philosophical Pills <a id="fpp" class="citation" href="http://www.fuel4design.org/index.php/future-philosophical-pills-downloadable-tools/">(2023)</a> are a set of prompt cards by fuel4design that work to allow designers to create narratives that allow for useful discussions around prospective futures. It could be argued that designing a narrative is an act of creative writing, and one that informs a lot of my creative practice. Over the course of this project, creating future narratives has allowed me to explore the wider implications of what I am designing. By considering these implications, I was able to use the methodology of de-futuring which was coined by Tony Fry <a id="fry" class="citation" href="https://www.designdarktimes.net/home/radical-thinkers-in-design/defuturing">(1999)</a> and defines the act of destructing the future through design. Through building these theoretical futures, I was able to think about how to best ensure that imagined scenarios don’t happen, or if they do, how design can be used to ensure that this future happens in a more considered, ethical way. In a way that protects women’s bodies in digital spaces.    
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      It’s important to use mechanisms such as de-futuring to understand how the systems that we put in place now could be detrimental to groups of people in the future, at the point where they are difficult to change. This is where incorporating the act of analysing our possible futures becomes important as a designer. The internet is susceptible, like any technology to path dependency. My primary concern is for what happens when the move fast and break things <a id="kirkpatrick" class="citation" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6urvN_4q9I">(Kirkpatrick, 2010)</a> mentality causes fractures that we only see fifty years in the future. The things that we break in digital spaces are less easy to fix than those in physical spaces, clumsy decisions can have huge consequences, Jaron Lanier phrases it like this: “If you love a medium made of software, there’s a danger that you will become entrapped in someone’s recent careless thoughts.” <a id="lanier" class="citation" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/You-Are-Not-Gadget-Manifesto/dp/0141049111">(Lanier, p22).</a> My work focuses around women’s digital design but I am also aware of the importance of working in this medium thoughtfully. It is for this reason that this critical report has been presented on a website coded by myself from scratch, by working with the raw code, I retain ownership and control over it. If my thoughts reject carelessness then let the medium I work with build upon as little of the wobbly foundations of the digital as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      In order for us to build digital spaces that work for women’s bodies, we must consider the role of the people who are building these technologies. According to TechNation, 26% of people working in technology are women <a id="wit" class="citation" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.womenintech.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Women-in-Tech-Survey-2023.pdf">(Women in Tech Survey, 2023)</a> and of these women, 76% of those who were interviewed reported experiencing gender bias or discrimination. It’s not difficult to understand why women opt out of the technology industry, however, it is important that they are there. We have seen examples of the harm that is caused when groups of people are omitted from the creation of new innovations. The aforementioned case of Joy Buolamwini <a id="buolamwini" class="citation" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf">(2017)</a> who discovered skin colour bias within facial recognition is a testament to this. By recognising the effects that instances like this have on societies, we can begin to change how we design, Jaron Lanier reminds us that “It is impossible to engage in information Technology without also engaging in social engineering” <a id="lanier" class="citation" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/You-Are-Not-Gadget-Manifesto/dp/0141049111">(Lanier, p22).</a> Social Engineering is a fact of life, but when enforced by one sole demographic can become a dangerous monoculture, devoid of creativity. This is where collage comes in, where we can begin to broaden our horizons through sticking demographics together to prevent old mistakes from repeating themselves.

    Assemblage has informed this inquiry both conceptually and in method. Within my practice,  the grouping and juxtaposition of imagery that collage provides unveils hidden questions and ideas. In this project, the method of collage runs further than that: I am interested in what happens when we take things apart and paste them back together again in order to breathe life into an idea. Over the course of this project, I have made paper collages and web-assemblages, I have gleaned words and articles and pictures and made them into case files, I have stuck AR bugs over the human body. So it seems only right that my final piece unites the eclectic nature of my experiments through a video game. The act of making a video game is assemblage, it’s cutting and sticking pieces of code, narrative and art together in a way that is interactive, playable. In this case, it allowed me to reject the corporeal body by placing the user into a body of my choosing, into a world of my creation. I am the witch who turns the prince into a frog, or rather a beetle.

    The insect in the game lives in a world of assemblage, amongst huge unblinking human eyeballs and flashing electricity and magical hardware. Pixels act as a glue, they knit all of these contradicting elements together into a world that constructs a metaphor for gender bias in technology. The motifs of the game become inseparable in this setting, mirroring the hardware behind a video game. “A console. A screen. A controller. A player, power supply, electricity. And yes, a game. None of these can perform their intended function unless connected one to the next as an assemblage.” <a id="reinhard" class="citation" href="https://archaeogaming.com/2017/11/01/assemblage-theory-and-video-games/ ">(Reinhard, 2017).</a> This quote utilises the DeLanda <a id="delanda" class="citation" href="https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-assemblage-theory.html">(DeLanda, 2016)</a> theory of Assemblage which builds upon Deleuze and Guattari <a id="deleuze" class="citation" href="link">(1987)</a> definition of the term which emphasises the rejection of unity in favour of multiplicity. <a id="nail" class="citation" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/26451291">(Nail, T. 2017)</a> This idea of multiplicity seemed perfectly fitting when considering the ideas surrounding the body in digital spaces. Dianne Currier considers how this method of thinking can translate to feminist technology, using Harraway’s theories on Cyborg Feminism to imagine how assemblage might allow us to think about the meetings of bodies and technologies beyond binary oppositions <a id="currier" class="citation" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/14647001030043005">(Currier, 2003).</a>
   </p>
   <p class="body-text">
    By using the principles of collage, we can begin to speculate on how we may be able to  change how we design technologies by cutting and pasting people from different backgrounds and disciplines together to create. An instance of this lies within the research agency Forensic Architecture. Composed of architects, software developers, filmmakers, investigative journalists, scientists, and lawyers, the agency works to “investigate state and corporate entities [] for their violent acts.” <a id="forensic" class="citation" href="https://forensic-architecture.org">(Forensic Architecture, 2024)</a> Their work is often used in legal processes and is an excellent example of what can happen when we use collage to build teams. By arranging artists with engineers and poets with data analysts, cutting and pasting women into spaces where they should have been all along to create a digital utopia: A space for everyone to breathe, to glitch and change and refuse, to cut, stick and paste in a place where they feel seen.   
  </p>
  <p class="body-text">
    Consider for example, Legacy Russel, the author of the manifesto Glitch Feminism. Russel is a Black writer who spent their adolescent years on the internet, trying on the different skins of the people that they couldn’t try on in the real world. By disregarding the corporeal body, they used the digital environment to learn what the world looked like through the eyes of people with different skin tones and gender identities. There is an element of play that is prevalent in this. The enactment of different ways of being harks back to the physical play that we experience as children, playground games of pretend. Russel reflects on this practice, saying that “Experimenting by donning different ‘skins’ becomes an act of empowerment, self discovery and even self care.” <a id="russel" class="citation" href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/460-glitch-feminism"></a>(Russel, pg 108)</a> But how about in adulthood? Can we use video games as methods of feminist play? 
  </p>
  <p class="body-text">
    I used this project to consider how feminist digital interventions can be used as weapons against a landscape of algorithmically perpetrated sexism. Identity is an integral part of the human psyche, and is something that the role of gender has a hand in moulding and manipulating. Mark Zuckerberg was once recorded stating that ‘You have one identity…The days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly…Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.’ <a id="kirkpatrick" class="citation" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jul/18/the-facebook-effect-david-kirkpatrick-book-review">(Kirpatrick, 2010).</a> Which is a concerning ideology if one begins to consider the importance of being able to shift identity for people who are not straight, white and male. In spaces which are not safe, we temporarily adopt identities which allow us to navigate in a fashion that is more acceptable, we tone down assertiveness or become more guarded in spaces where we are at risk. To object to this self-constructed camouflage as a lack of integrity disregards the gendered and racial expectations of identity. 
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      The practice of tailoring digital identity is articulated well by the term online identity reconstruction. This has been defined as the act of building online identities through which one changes or hides certain characteristics <a id="huetal" class="citation" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215003143?casa_token=-TwA4_0BBFcAAAAA:MJ_8AN-UIVkOIWsPTwqU1_ciwrrHHwoXXETX8MuaTh8eAqCyJnvqx3qvTIKrzJZ22R7wuWP7Ug">(Hu et al, 2015).</a> The act of changing and hiding characteristics online holds a survivalist mentality in a similar way to interactions that take place in real life, identity reconstruction often becomes a way to ensure the presented identity matches [their] different goals in social network communities. (Hu et al, 2015) It is important however to recognise who is in control of these goals, how many of them are formed by an aspiration to conform to the environments that we find ourselves in? And how many of these environments have been built on structures which do not take large demographics into account through design? 
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      Alfie Bown confronts these issues in his series of essays about the political dynamics of online romance titled Dream Lovers. Bown argues that “When we are turned into digital objects, when we are ‘datafied’, we have identity politics structurally imposed. To break this pattern, we need a different approach to data and how we use it” <a id="bown" class="citation" href="https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745344874/dream-lovers/">(Bown, 2022).</a> I wonder whether the problem resides in data or in the precursor to the data: the attitudes that we have perpetrated onto the intersection of identity and gender for years. As our physical personhood begins to fuse with these platforms, I want to make people aware of alternate ways of breeding creative ingenuity as a form of resistance in technology.     
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
    Ingenuity can be defined as “Inventive skill or imagination; cleverness.” <a id="ingenuity" class="citation" href="https://search.credoreference.com/articles/Qm9va0FydGljbGU6NDQyNDAyNg==?aid=275139">(‘Ingenuity’, 2016),</a> it is this element of imagination that I think is important to emphasise when considering how we can resist sexism in digital spaces. Through ingenuity we can begin to construct more emotional and extreme ideas of perspective digital futures, allowing for a more considered approach to thinking about how what we design now will affect different people in the future. The science fiction genre allows us to explore these scenarios in a way which is accessible for the masses, exemplified by Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid's Tale <a id="handmaid" class="citation" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Handmaids-Tale-Contemporary-Classics/dp/0099740915">(1985).</a> We see this in campaigns surrounding abortion rights, the red-cloaked figures holding signs have become a staple of our portrayal of the war on women’s bodies. Yet this visual didn’t exist until the 1985 release of The Handmaid’s Tale which envisions a society, scarily close to our own in which women have become completely powerless.

      I first read The Handmaid’s Tale when I was sixteen and I devoured it. The role that narrative had in expanding my understanding of gender dynamics continues to influence my practice as a designer through writing. Creative writing can be considered a form of collage, it allows the writer to construct new worlds and scenarios by placing story next to actions and characters. Through this method of patchwork, I have found myself confronting uncomfortable pasts and futures, however, through analysis of these worlds I have learned how to look at our current climate critically. By laying subjects out flat through play, I began to consider and rearrange how we can look at gender and the body in a more optimistic light.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      Themes surrounding assemblage and the body can be exemplified by the science fiction genre. The film Poor Things <a id="poorthings" class="citation" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14230458/">(Lanthimos, 2023)</a> informed the direction of my inquiry. Poor Things is a movie about a woman who is brought back to life with her babies’ brain inserted into her head. The notion of a baby's brain navigating an adult's body in an adult world acts as a surreal collage, allowing elements of the world that has been created in the story seem intensely more cruel, wondrous and interesting than they might have been through an adult's lens. The development of Bella’s identity holds a mirror to the audience, her innocence allows us to question the world through her eyes. The effect of this is a more empathy led approach to considering societal problems through worldbuilding. The influence on my work has been instrumental in how I use strange and delightful narratives in order to question feminist issues.

    My final project focuses on the creation of a video game which takes inspiration from the gothic. The fantastical nature of the gothic lens allows for the debate of serious and often divisive subjects like technology bias through storytelling which is distanced enough from our world to not feel like a lecture, but an experience. The Feminist haunting of gothic fiction has occurred since the early 1800s with the works of Anne Ratcliffe and Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein. The Victorian era saw a surge in women both consuming and writing gothic literature, its popularity at the time was attributed to the stereotype that women were the “imaginative” sex <a id="mckie" class="citation" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/she-said/2014/oct/17/the-love-of-all-things-creepy-how-women-were-the-early-goths">(McKie, 2014)</a> and men were just more rational. But in retrospect there’s an element of subversion in the image of these rich, upper-class, ‘propper’ Victorian ladies writing creepy tales of the mysterious and supernatural. Texts such as Frankenstein <a id="shelly" class="citation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein">(Shelly, 1818),</a> The Mysteries of Udolpho <a id="radcliffe" class="citation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysteries_of_Udolpho">(Radcliffe, 1794)</a> and Jane Eyre <a id="bronte" class="citation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre">(Brontë, 1847)</a> reclaimed the power of the label “imaginative sex” by building a genre.

    The history of Gothic fiction is rich with women’s voices, but the connection between women and the supernatural goes much deeper than the Victorian era. It’s no little known fact that women have been accused of witchcraft for centuries, the accusations, trials and death wind their way through European history. The beginnings of most witch allegations were spurred by incidents taking place in the women’s realm. They were accused of killing children and disrupting fertility, or of spoiling beer or bread making, or of drying up cows so that they couldn’t be milked. These acts all attacked female-dominated activities <a id="millar" class="citation" href="https://stories.uq.edu.au/shorthand-uq/small-change/women-as-witches/#:~:text=Witches%20were%20often%20believed%20to,all%20attacked%20female%2Ddominated%20activities.">(Millar, 2017).</a> The accusations targeted the powerless, but they particularly hit women who didn’t live according  to the idea of what a woman ‘should’ be. Those who were poor, often elderly, widowed, single (Millar, 2017) were most likely to be accused of witchcraft.

    We see modern witchcraft take many forms: spell work, plant-based healing, activism, and more <a id="n_fry" class="citation" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/the-many-faces-of-women-who-identify-as-witches">(Fry, 2018).</a> Online platforms provide spaces for the dissemination of occult ideas through communities like WitchTok and r/witchcraft <a id="reddit" class="citation" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/">(reddit, 2011).</a> In digital spheres that can often be hostile to people who are women and people who deviate from societal norms, we can see how these spaces act as magical sanctuaries, how modern witchcraft lets people dream up their own belief systems, and lets women and non-binary people come to the fore. <a id="saville" class="citation" href="https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/meet-londons-next-gen-witches">(Saville, 2022).</a>

    Bug Online is my final project at CSM. Wanting to learn new computation skills, I embarked on a game design project which aims to release women from the confines of digital design bias. It follows a woman living in a dystopic future who turns herself into a bug in order to dismantle algorithmic forms of oppression. The game plays on the De Beauvoir quote “It’s irresistible temptation for a young woman to be part of a privileged cast when she can do so just by surrendering her body” <a id="deb" class="citation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Sex">(De Beauvoir, 1949)</a> by allowing the user to play as a woman who surrenders her body to binary in order to fix a broken and dangerous algorithm. This project investigates what the future of gender and technology might look like and how we can begin to de-future it now. I take reference from feminist gothic histories in building unbelievable narratives that can be used to build warnings and construct optimistic potential futures. The game becomes a set of tarot cards, telling the user one future so that they can dream up another.

    Tarot, spells and potions. In my work, I apply the magic lens to technology by creating little pieces of coded digital delight to disrupt sexist design. Websites that cast a hex to make people pay attention, bewitching games, code embellished with poetry. 
    I am a witch and my spells summon feminist delight.

    But I am not the only magical being in this world, Theo Triantafyllidis conjures otherworldly Mixed Realities in his work which meditates on the body and sexuality. The avatars he uses are distinctly non-human, feeling like characters or creatures from a fantasy video game. In the work Studio Visit <a id="studiovis" class="citation" href="https://slimetech.org/works/studio-visit">(Triantafyllidis, 2018),</a> we see his Orc avatar working interacting with a set resembling a studio, whilst the avatar muses to itself: 
   </p>
   <p class="quote body-text">
“And this is my new body. <br>
My old body felt so uncomfortable and saggy. <br>
Now I am strong. <br>
And I am sexy. ” <br>
   </p>
   <p class="body-text">
    The avatar has a muscular physique, it is a distinctly Queer body, with a hint of the fantastical, as we see the avatar stroll around on a pair of black paws. The monologue it speaks emphasises the power in building an identity that feels more representative of themself. Digital formats allow for transformation in a way in which we don’t see in the real world. We watch this Orc interact with the space through a VR window, the act feels intimate and almost soft which contradicts how we view Orcs in fictional settings. Whilst prevalent in folklore, the Orcs that  we see in pop culture reside in Tolkein’s Middle Earth. They are brutish, violent and malevolent. This Orc defies expectations, we see the plight of an Orc that sees themself differently, an Orc who just wants to make art. Perhaps it unveils more about the artist’s working process than a video of Triantafyllidis would alone. He embodies Legacy Russel’s <a id="russel" class="citation" href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/460-glitch-feminism"></a>(Russel, 2020)</a> commentary on technology and shapeshifting, both show us how we can use technology to understand gender in digital environments.

    Triantafyllidis’ practice wrestles with identity through non-human bodies, speaking to feelings of escapism through video game style aesthetics. I feel that my current practice places myself adjacent to Triantafyllidis’ practice, by creating a conversation between the physical and the digital bodies of women, using interaction and games. There’s an element of play that I think is important in these conversations and follows the narrative of my practice. Play is something that helps us understand the world in a more optimistic manner, as children we learn through play but we tend to lose this as adults. A yearning for play influences the elements of interaction within my practice, a fascination for how code can be used as a spell to make magic for women in both the physical and digital worlds.

    Creative writing as witchcraft is demonstrated so beautifully by the podcast and blog The White Pube by Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad who write eclectically, weaving physical and digital worlds into one. They review exhibitions taking place in physical spaces, social media accounts, world events and video games. These texts are placed on their website on a level playing field; you might find speculative fiction about Come Dine With Me next to a review about an exhibition by Alina Grassman. Consequently, the site becomes a collage, representative of the dialogues both within and without the art worlds. They write like they are “falling through [their] feelings” <a id="white_pube" class="citation" href="https://thewhitepube.co.uk/podcasts/">(Muhammad and de la Puente, 2024),</a> and speak about video games like they are masterpieces, with so much emotion that the reviews are transformed into living, breathing poetry. In this act of witchery, it becomes possible for us to consider criticism as an art form, place as poetry and games as reflections of the world that we live in.

    So, let's cast spells on all we can, let's enchant digital futures with poetry and art and forethought.

   <h1>the bug</h1>
   <p class="first-para body-text">
    Bug Online is the story of a woman shapeshifting into a computer bug. The motif of the bug has occurred frequently over the course of this project, due to its relationship with computers. The term ‘computer bug’ was first coined in 1947 when a computer scientist Dr Grace Hopper found an insect inside of a computer, preventing it from working <a id="nat" class="citation" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/worlds-first-computer-bug/ ">(National Geographic Society, 2023).</a> It then went on to become a piece of terminology instantly understandable to most of the population. The term bug has since come to mean a flaw or glitch in a system (National Geographic Society, 2023). This project utilises the visualisation of a bug as a way to explore overlooked identities in digital spaces, particularly women.

    Insects can be small and troublesome, I know many people who hate flies and squirm around woodlouse. We live amongst these tiny creatures but don’t necessarily like to be reminded of it. When applied to the language of computation, bugs can become a metaphor of the uncomfortable complexities of building software without including the outliers in the data. They are at times a nuisance to deal with but they’re bright, beautiful and they do some incredibly important things for us and the planet. They are simultaneously often put under a microscope and examined. We can draw similarities to the treatment of images of women in online spaces. By allowing the player of Bug Online to shift into a bug, I want people to be reminded of their position in digital spaces in a playful way and examine the ethics behind the technologies that we use now.
   </p>
   <p class="body-text">
    This project provided so much space for speculation on the ethics of technology and inclusive design. Technology is riddled with concerns over data ethics. Through working with machine learning libraries, I have become increasingly aware of the datasets that these libraries have been trained on. We can look at the example of PoseNet, a library that I worked with during the experimentation for this project. PoseNet is a javascript library which allows for real time pose detection, it is trained on the ImageNet dataset, created from images that have been scraped from the internet without consent. <a id="xiang" class="citation" href="https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/153/1/250/119940/Mirror-Mirror-on-the-Wall-Who-s-the-Fairest-of">(Xiang, 2024)</a> While this method allows for a large dataset to be collected, it does make us question how we can develop both ethical and diverse technologies. Half of the battle is seeking out these bugs and examining how they got to the state that they are in now. It relies on an Entomological approach to technology.
   </p>
   <p class="body-text">
    Entomology is the study of insects and their relationship to humans and the environment around them. The website exposing AI could be considered a form of digital entomology, the site uses case studies on databases that AI software is trained on in order to give transparency to the users of the datasets. They also provide maps that document where and how these datasets have gone on to be used, highlighting the morality of some of these databases. Whilst exposing AI attempts to improve AI understanding, my practice uses digital entomology to understand the relationship between technology design decisions and humans. I want to uncover the complexities behind a medium that we all take for granted.

    I make work for women. I have previously felt guilt over leaving men and gender non conforming people out of design but through my practice, but I have developed an understanding that there needs to be design made for explicitly women. As my earlier study on Henry Dreyfruss’ The Measure of Man considers, when you design for everyone, it just doesn’t work. If most of the world follows the standards set for men, I want to perpetrate a narrative that allows women to feel that their needs are accommodated for. By setting a precedent where women feel that they can take up space in areas where they are underrepresented, we can ensure that they are involved in decision making, in research, in knowledge production, [so that] women do not get forgotten. <a id="perez" class="citation" href="https://carolinecriadoperez.com/book/invisible-women/">(Perez, C. 2022).</a>

   <p class="first-para body-text">
    Throughout this report I have analysed the history of design bias to look for ways in which we can create future technologies which don't leave women behind. I have explored this subject through collage, witchcraft and insects. Through the medium of collage, we can imagine new realities, through witchcraft, we can make them become a reality and through the lens of insects we can recognise the bugs in the systems that we build upon. I have weaved a web out of these lenses to consider how they influence my own creative practice and how they intersect with the practices of others. I have gathered from Legacy Russel’s shapeshifting, picked up poetry from The White Pube and chanted with Theo Triantafyllidis’ Orc, and I have formulated a potion that allows my practice to grow, as a gothic tech-witch. As a collage of unrelated elements that can cast coded spells to counteract the hexes of our past biases.
